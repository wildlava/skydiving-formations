* Make gallery-centered image after fling stops) become selected image
* Add save/load dive
* Why gallery spaced on large screen?  Why does center frame not look "done"
  initially or on orientation change?
* Should we preserve state when back button to home is used
  (i.e. use onPause()/onResume())?
* Do better job regarding formation image size, scaling, layout, etc.

Non-critical:

* Check access of methods (e.g. onCreate() - public/protected?)
  - callbacks (referenced from, e.g., buttons) need to be public
